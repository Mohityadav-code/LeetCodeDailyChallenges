    <h1>You are given n​​​​​​ tasks labeled from 0 to n - 1 represented by a 2D integer array tasks, where tasks[i] =
        </br> [enqueueTimei, processingTimei] means that the i​​​​​​th​​​​ task will be available to process at
        enqueueTimei and will
        </br> take processingTimei to finish processing.
        </br>
        <h2>
            You have a single-threaded CPU that can process at most one task at a time and will act in the following
            way:

            <ul>
                <li>If the CPU is idle and there are no available tasks to process, the CPU remains idle.</li>
                <li>
                    If the CPU is idle and there are available tasks, the CPU will choose the one with the shortest

                </li>
                <li>
                    processing time. If mlitiple tasks have the same shortest processing time, it will choose the task
                    with
                    the smallest index.

                </li>
                <li>

                    Once a task is started, the CPU will process the entire task without stopping.
                </li>
                <li>

                    The CPU can finish a task then start a new one instantly.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Return the order in which the CPU will process the tasks.

                </li>
            </ul>

        Example : Input: tasks = [[1,2],[2,4],[3,2],[4,1]]
        Output: [0,2,3,1]
        Explanation: The events go as follows: 
        - At time = 1, task 0 is available to process. Available tasks = {0}.
        - Also at time = 1, the idle CPU starts processing task 0. Available tasks = {}.
        - At time = 2, task 1 is available to process. Available tasks = {1}.
        - At time = 3, task 2 is available to process. Available tasks = {1, 2}.
        - Also at time = 3, the CPU finishes task 0 and starts processing task 2 as it is the shortest. Available tasks = {1}.
        - At time = 4, task 3 is available to process. Available tasks = {1, 3}.
        - At time = 5, the CPU finishes task 2 and starts processing task 3 as it is the shortest. Available tasks = {1}.
        - At time = 6, the CPU finishes task 3 and starts processing task 1. Available tasks = {}.
        - At time = 10, the CPU finishes task 1 and becomes idle.
